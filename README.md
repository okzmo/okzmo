# Hey there! I'm Mathieu "okzmo" Rossi. 

I'm mostly self-taught and I've been learning as much as I can for the past 2-3 years, with a focus on web development since that's the first field I ever encountered. Now I try to get involved in other fields I can reasonably understand and I'm mostly having fun with random ideas that comes to mind.

## What's keeping you busy these days?

- Mostly having existantial crisis everytime I come up with a new idea because "it's not good enough" or "it's just another crud app", apart from that networking has particularly caught my eye - it's the first non-web domain which truly grabbed my attention. Also eyeing game UI development (soonâ„¢).
- Crafting [nosync](https://nosync.app), my take on a personal knowledge management system (think mymind, but with my own twist on UI and features).

## What's next on the horizon?

- Building cool stuff that matters (or at least entertains me).
- Continuously learning and growing (that's the most generic sentence I've ever wrote).
