# Hey there! I'm Mathieu "okzmo" Rossi. 

I'm mostly self-taught and I've been learning as much as I can for the past 2-3 years, with a focus on web development since that's the first field I ever encountered. Now I try to get involved in other fields I can reasonably understand and I'm mostly having fun with random ideas that comes to mind.

What I did until now: (TL;DR: Lot of dead projects but plenty of learning.)
- Crafting [nosync](https://nosync.app), my take on a personal knowledge management system (think mymind, but with my own twist on UI and features).
- [kyono](https://kyono.app), A linktree but with a new UI.
- An image optimization service in Go for a web3 company.
- My take on a new way to communicate with "kyob", just a prototype.

What's next:
Anything really, I like to build stuff, tools, apps, as long as it pick my interest I'm down.
