# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mathieu (math or okzmo works too). While I may not qualify myself as a SWE (because I'm not an engineer clearly), I don't think I fall short when it comes to actually doing the work whatever it can be. I'm mostly self-taught who's been learning as much as I can for the past 2-3 years, with a focus on web development since that's the first field I encountered, but I try to get involved in everything I can reasonably understand. My journey has taken me through the realms of both frontend and backend for now, working with Go, Rust, and JS/TS ecosystems and runtimes (Node.js, Deno, you name it).

## What's keeping you busy these days?

Glad you ask! (My inner voice insisted I answer this question)

- Breaking free from the "web-only developer" stereotype by diving into low-level programming. Networking has particularly caught my eye - it's the first non-web domain that's truly grabbed my attention. Also eyeing game UI development (soonâ„¢).
- Crafting NOSYNC, my take on a personal knowledge management system (think mymind, but with my own twist on UI and features).
- Attempting to befriend mathematics again (I actually scare myself with how long I take to solve simple math problems from time to time).

## What's next on the horizon?

Glad you ask! (Promise this is the last time I talk to myself)

- Stepping out of my comfort zone to contribute to open source projects. Not for the resume bling, but to experience what it's like working on larger-scale projects with diverse teams. You could say I'm on a mission to level up my soft-skills.
- Building cool stuff that matters (or at least entertains me).
- Continuously learning and growing (that's the most generic sentence I've ever wrote).

### How can I contact you?

Gla...

- LinkedIn mostly since I only have twitter to look at cool design and discord.
